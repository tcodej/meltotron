# meltotron
A simple web interface to generate XML for my Meltotron DecentSampler preset.

I don't expect anyone other than myself to find this useful. And I'll only find it useful again if I discover a new Mellotron sample pack that I want to add.

See [DecentSampler developer resources](https://www.decentsamples.com/decent-sampler-developer-resources/) for more information.

I used samples found freely on the web, but had to [rename](https://www.advancedrenamer.com/) the files to suit my needs. Use as you see fit.
